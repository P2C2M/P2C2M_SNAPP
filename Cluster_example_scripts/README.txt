### Scripts for running posterior predictive datasets with SNAPP on a cluster ###

Purpose:
P2C2M.SNAPP simulates posterior predictive datasets from empirical SNAPP output. To 
conduct posterior predictive analyses, these posterior predictive datasets must be 
analyzed with SNAPP. Due to the computational requirements of SNAPP, it is recommended
that these analyses be performed on a cluster. The three scripts provided are an example
how this may be done. Note: Not all clusters are the same and some adjustments to the 
scripts may be necessary.

Setup:
Posterior predictive xml files generated by P2C2M.SNAPP should be uploaded to the cluster 
in the same directory. Place the pbs_template and masterscript files in the same 
directory.


Scripts:

1. pbs_template - this is the template for the script that will be submitted to the 
cluster. You may need to adjust the walltime, requested resources, etc. SNAPP is able to 
use multiple threads; however more threads does not necessarily equal faster runtime. You 
may need to experiment with the number of threads to achieve the fastest runtime. For my 
analyses on my cluster, 8 threads provided the best results.

2. masterscript - this script uses the pbs_template to create a pbs file for each xml file
and submits each pbs file to the cluster.

To run, just execute ./masterscript in the command line of your cluster. This will create 
a PBS script for each xml file and submit each of them to the cluster.
